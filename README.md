# Tribute-Page
Tribute Website | (Website Submissions)
This is my second official HTML5 and CSS project, this time with a more base knowledge of the two languages. I created a more realistic website where a user can view the facts about Abraham Lincoln. Again I implemented the use of git pushing saves with descriptions of each save to better understand the steps I took to complete this project.
